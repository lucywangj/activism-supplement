    <p>
      <strong>At The Daily Princetonian</strong>, we’re used to focusing on the present — reporting on stories that
      unfold as we write.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this project, we at the ‘Prince’, the second-oldest college newspaper in the country, took a step back.
      Leveraging data from the <a href="https://theprince.princeton.edu/">The Daily Princetonian Larry Dupraz
        Archives</a>, kindly shared with us by Mudd Library, we immersed ourselves in decades worth of print
      publications in the hope of better understanding the journey the ‘Prince’ and the University have been on over the
      past 140 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help you explore our findings, for each decade, we’ve summarized a few emblematic terms, sized relatively to
      their popularity. Clicking on a particular emblematic term will allow you to see a chart of the frequency with
      which it appeared in the ‘Prince’ over time. Additionally, we’ve included search functionality if you’d like to
      see a
      frequency chart for words of your own choosing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like The Pudding’s <a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/12/brief-history/">New York Times headlines project</a> that
      served as our inspiration, in order to find terms particularly emblematic of a particular decade, we compared word
      usage frequencies between a decade and the preceding and following decades — selecting terms that were used
      disportionately more often in the decade at hand as compared to neighboring decades. You can read more on this
      process in our <a href="#methodology">methodology section</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This summary is only a bird’s eye view of the information the archives hold, and we hope our work here inspires
      further analysis with its wealth of data.

            During that decade, The Daily Princetonian covered sports news in immense detail, regularly incorporating <a

            school’s baseball team — rather than political or news-based terms, showed up with the greatest frequency.

            In 1877, Lasell Leaves, the magazine of Lasell University (a private university in Massachusetts), <a

            Princeton’s campus, with the word “performance” spiking in frequency compared to neighboring decades.

            members of the newly founded department. Nikolsky’s contributions helped to establish the department as a
            leading center for study of the rotary-wing aircraft. Amid growth of aeronautical efforts, mentions of the

              of 2014</a> as racial justice uprisings swept the nation. A year later, the group orchestrated a march on
            Nassau Hall, calling on the University to create affinity spaces for Black students, mandate cultural
            competency training for faculty, and remove Woodrow Wilson Class of 1879’s name from Princeton’s policy
            school and first residential college, among other demands.

      <strong>Methodology</strong>
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Sources</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The data used in our analysis for all years proceeding 2015 was sourced directly from Mudd Library, which shared
      with the ‘Prince’ a database containing optical character recognition (OCR) data from the Larry Dupraz archive. We
      did not independently verify this database against the raw image data in the archive or Princeton University
      Library’s archive explorer. For years succeeding 2015, the ‘Prince’ used data from internal web archives.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Cleaning</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We first removed all tokens of the form ’xx to prevent class year attributions from dominating frequency analysis.
      We removed all capitalization and punctuation in order to ensure that errors in OCR, which can frequently
      miscaptialize letters or insert unnecessary punctuation, would not prevent terms from being recognized. This means
      that all emblematic terms are not case sensitive, e.g. tokens like “princeton,” “Princeton,” “pRinceton” are all
      recognized as the same term.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Term Extraction</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ‘Prince’ used a whitespace tokenizer to count word frequencies for each decade. Then, for each analyzed
      decade, we compared the frequency of all terms in that decade against a corpus containing data for that decade and
      the preceding and following decades. For the 2010s and 1880s, we used the single neighboring decade. Like <a
        href="https://pudding.cool/2018/12/brief-history/">The Pudding</a>, we only included words that were used at
      least once in 10,000 words in each decade to ensure the relevancy of analyzed terms. Using each decade’s list of
      disproportionately used words, we then searched the archives to find historically and culturally relevant uses of
      those words to share in the summaries.
